## Technologies Used
The main technologies used in the system includes :
• Ethereum - Ethereum network acts as the core pillar of the system where all the block
details are stored in the chain.
• Solidity- The main language used for making contracts and interacting with the Blockchain
network.
• Web3JS- Web3JS is an advanced version of Javascript which plays an essential role in
carrying out transactions and contract calls.
• MaterialUI- The entire framework is being integrated with React’s Material UI framework.
• Truffle Suite- Truffle suite package comes up with tools for implementing and migrating
contracts as well as setting up a local Blockchain network.
• Metamask- One common wallet used for making transactions is Metamask where all
account addresses are registered with their associated public and private keys.
• Maps API- For better traceability and experience, the system is integrated with a
google maps api key which tracks the exact location for the product.
