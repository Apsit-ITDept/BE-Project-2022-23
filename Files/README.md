Devanagari is the most used script in India. The lack of use of this script in the digital
space has held it back from being relevant and even popular. Younger generation is
not using the script and gravitate towards English as it is easily available in the
Digital format.
The script however, is popular in the handwritten medium. There are no popular ways
to digitize the Devnagari script in real-time.
The most used way is by people. Human error is a factor in that method however
Most of the clerical work is done in India is done in English but that is just for the
more urban areas. In rural areas the government offices still use the local languages.
Most of them are handwritten.
It takes more human effort and time to fill that information in the system. The factor
of human error is also significant.
The problem Statement:"The user wants to digitize a piece of document that is handwritten in the Devanagari
script with the help of a mobile app."
