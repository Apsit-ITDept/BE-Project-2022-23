## About
The project aims to create a decentralized platform for supply chain management using Blockchain technology and smart contracts.The platform enables all supply chain stakeholders to participate and have a clear and immutable record of all transactions, from raw material sourcing to final product delivery. The smart contract’s features include verifying the authenticity of goods, ensuring regulatory compliance, and automating payment processes. The transparency and security of the Blockchain network prevent fraudulent activities such as counterfeiting or data tampering.
