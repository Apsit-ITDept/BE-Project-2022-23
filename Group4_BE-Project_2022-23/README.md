# IoT Enabled Traffic Divergence System for Emergency Serivces

The rapid rise in vehicle numbers, which has grown serious in the wake of the startling
increase in global population, is one of the most significant effects of modern technology
development. The delay in getting to the destination is therefore the main problem here.
With the use of IOT, to create a system that will
allow emergency vehicles, such as ambulances, to get at their location as quickly as possible.
A smartphone application that will allow drivers and traffic controllers to communicate
with each other is currently being developed. We would provide the ambulance’s driver the
ability to specify the locations of the source and destination. Digital screens placed near
traffic lights will show the lane that the traffic controller chose. Other highway users will be
able to separate themselves or change lanes before the ambulance arrives if they can observe
the notification on the screen. A lack of effective traffic management can result in thousands
of deaths since an ambulance won’t be able to get to the hospital in time. However, the issue
is getting worse since annual vehicle growth is currently at 11% while annual road expansion
is just around 4% in developing nations like India. So, to address this issue, the project offers
a fresh, simple solution for traffic control in emergency scenarios.
